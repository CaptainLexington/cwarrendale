## **Was Roger Right** about *I Spit On Your Grave*?

[Oh heavens no](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-spit-on-your-grave-1980).

>A vile bag of garbage named "I Spit on Your Grave" is playing in Chicago theaters this week. It is a movie so sick, reprehensible and contemptible that I can hardly believe it's playing in respectable theaters, such as Plitt's United Artists. But it is. Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of, my life [*sic*].

[*I Spit On Your Grave*](http://amzn.to/1VjpvcY) is a pretty legendary film, as far as grindhouse goes. I don't even remember the first time I heard of it because I've known about it forever. It was such a cultural force it founded the genre of "rape/revenge" films, and with that you also have a pretty clear idea of the plot: a woman is raped, and she gets revenge.

None of this is to say that the movie is obviously good because it is well-known or influential. In fact, I went into this movie expecting bog-standard low-budget exploitation fare, with a reputation built entirely on shock value—and I am not easily shocked.

This movie surprised me. It was good in ways best described by negating every part of the following excerpt from Roger's review: 

>This is a film without a shred of artistic distinction. It lacks even simple craftsmanship. There is no possible motive for exhibiting it, other than the totally cynical hope that it might make money.

Actually, it is craftsmanship and craftsmanship alone that redeems this movie. In this post-*Grave* world there are rape/revenge movies that aren't worth the bits they take up on [Mill Creek Entertaiment](http://www.millcreekent.com/)'s hard drives. It is not culturally important to simply show rapists getting murdered. What sets *Grave* apart is that the filmmakers really believed they were making a motion picture. 

For instance, if the film only meant to show a graphic rape followed by graphic violence with the thinnest veneer of justification, you'd think it might not spend half an hour setting up the characters before the rape happens.

Furthermore, if the film was made entirely without craft or art, you might think that this half-hour of set-up was boring or pointless, but it was not. 

>The story of "I Spit on Your Grave" is told with moronic simplicity.

>There is no attempt to develop the personalities of the characters - they are, simply, a girl and four men, one of them mentally retarded.

There are two seemingly contradictary responses to this:
1. That's wrong. There are several character-building moments through the entire narrative.
1. It's true that the characters are not fleshed out *in detail*, but this is thematically important.

Let's deal with these one at a time.

### The Characters Are Not Blank Slates

The characters are not facile stock clichés, either. The heroine runs the biggest risk of this—she's a city writer visiting the country so she can focus on a novel she's writing that is clearly just about herself. You know, the default Stephen King protagonist, and also Stephen King. The relationship between the four men is complicated, even beyond the obvious factor of the mentally handicapped Matthew.  Even the ringleader Johnny's clueless wife, who only appears in two scenes, shows more character than Ebert's charge suggests.

My favorite moment of character building appears in a scene in which the four men sit in the local diner two weeks after the rape. Stanley blurts out details of the crime loudly enough to be overheard, and Johnny hits him and scolds him. Stanley feels guilty and is visibly hurt by Johnny's outburst. Johnny, a man who orchestrated the rape and, he believes, murder of a woman and feels no ounce of remorse, *feels guilty that he has upset his friend*, and tries to coax a smile out of him<label for="sn-ladykiller" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-ladykiller" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote">He says one of Stan's "classic Ladykiller smiles."</span>. I found this terrifying, and so should you. Perhaps Roger did too, but forgot that that was the point of the film.

### The Characters Are Supposed to Be Vague

The film *is* supposed to be terrifying, by the way. Not from shock value or jump scares, but from plausibility. This is why the characterization is so subtle: the characters in this movie could be *anyone*.

As Jennifer Hills pulls into the gas station when she gets to the town where she has rented her summer home, the conversation she has with the gas station attendant is so benign and bereft of the grim foreboding so beloeved of cabin-in-the-woods-style exploitation that my earlier suspicions she was already talking to her would-be rapist were put to rest. It was only when the film returned to his character multiple times without introducing any others I realized this guy really was capable of the atrocity for which this film is famous.

Later, Jennifer lures Johnny out into woods where he raped her, and forces him to strip at gunpoint. She is about to put him down execution-style when he tries to justify his actions by referring to their first interaction, giving classic lines about leading him on with her scanty dress and coquettish behavior. We've all heard these arguments before, of course—and Jennifer is so appalled she decides he deserves a more personalized death.

The message is clear: rape can happen to anyone, and anyone can commit rape. The entire film is structured around this idea.

>[There is] an unbelievably grotesque and inappropriate scene in which she enters a church and asks forgiveness for the murders she plans to commit.

This scene is kind of unnecessary, and the lone organist playing to an empty church makes it surreal-borderline-silly, but I did not find it grotesque or inappropriate, least of all unbelievably so. Perhaps this is because I lack religious feeling, but [Roger was not exactly brimming with it himself](http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/how-i-believe-in-god).

>How did the audience react to all of this? Those who were vocal seemed to be eating it up. The middle-aged, white-haired man two seats down from me, for example, talked aloud, After the first rape: "That was a good one!" After the second: "That'll show her!" After the third: "I've seen some good ones, but this is the best."

That is indefensible. I am appalled—though not surprised—that anybody reacted this way to this film and I am happy to report that the crowd I saw it with reacted with due solemnity—which is to say, not at all. I cannot say if my feelings on the film would have been colored by such an environment, nor do I wish to insult Roger by claiming he could have had his artistic judgment so easily clouded, but such an experience would certainly have left a rotten taste in my mouth not easily forgotten.

## In Conclusion

**My Score**: 4/5

**Roger's Score**: Thumb's Down. (Not even a star rating!)

**Was Roger Right?** No, and neither was anyone he saw it with.
