	Imagine that, sometime about 1950, it had been decided, collectively, informally, a little at a time, but with finality, to proscribe every kind of novel from the canon of the future but the nurse romance. Not merely from the critical canon, but from the store racks and library shelves as well. Nobody could be paid, published, lionized, or cherished among the gods of literature for writing any kind of fiction other than nurse romances. Now, because of my faith and pride in the diverse and rigorous brilliance of American writers of the last half-century, I do believe that from this bizarre decision, in this theoretical America, a dozen or more authentic masterpieces would have emerged. Thomas Pynchon's **Blitz Nurse**, for example, and Cynthia Ozick's **Ruth Puttermesser, R.N.**  One imagines, however, that this particular genre—that any genre, even one far less circumscribed in its elements and possibilities than the nurse romance—would have paled somewhat by the year 2002. Over the last year in that oddly diminished world, somebody, somewhere, would be laying down Michael Chabon's **Dr. Kavalier and Nurse Clay** with a weary sigh and crying out, "Surely, oh, surely there must be more to the novel than this!"

Chabon, writing above in the preface to *McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales*, is hinting towards short stories with his alternate-universe analogy, but his description might equally apply to where we find ourselves in the world of videogames. "Conflicts resolvable by force" easily accounts for something like 80% of AAA games or more, and far, far more of the indie scene than we would like to admit. Throw in "Conflicts resolvable by contrived inventory puzzles" and "Conflicts solvable by Thinking with Portals™", and we can fill in the blanks of just about every narrative-based videogame on the market. Stray too far from this path, and people will start to wonder whether you are really a *game* at all.

But in fact, the expressivity of videogames as a medium is limited by more factors than a restrictive set of acceptable game modes. There are cultural and conventional barriers to a more diverse videogame landscape that may even be more important than emphasis on win/lose gameplay. These are, I believe, the prime offenders: 

##Concept of Value

The concept of value dominant in videogames is more or less tied to the quantity of content. AAA games are already too expensive, with costs sunk into hyer-detailed graphical assets, and the problems only compound when the game starts feeling insecure about its length and tries to throw in padded levels, extra game modes, cosmetic unlockables and what have you to seem like a better deal. At best, these efforts are trivial distractions that don't meaningfully contribute to the experience and are easy to ignore; at worst, they distract the designer from creating a tighter, richer experience, and the player from giving the game their full critical attention. *Batman: Arkham Asylum*, a perfectly delightful linear experience, with a decent open-world (that is inexplicably decided to fence off after completing the story mode), came with absolutley unecessary "challenge arenas" that dropped the player, as Batman, into contextly rooms to fight contextless hordes of contextless thugs. I do not expect that this added greatly to the perceived value of *Arkham Asylum* to many players, but it certainly distracted the development team and likely contributed to its development cost. To what end? I believe *B:AA* did not feel confident in presenting its story campaign as an entire experience.

Although I favor story-based, single-player linear games, this problem is by no means unique to them. Online multiplayer FPSes often come with bot-mode for single-player play. The bots are usually unplayably dumb (or unplayable advanced!). Why bother? Because a videogame can't just be one thing to one demographic. It has to offer as much content as possible to as large an audience as possible, regardless of whether any of that content suffers from the lack of focus.

One of my favorite games of all time is *To The Moon*. I've played it once; it took about six hours, and I did it all in a single sitting. It was one of the most memorable, powerful experiences I've had with a game, and it was worth the money far, far more than many games that focus on quantity of content and game modes. *To The Moon*'s concept of value came not from providing the most easily-quanitifiable-bang for your buck, but from delivering the best experience it had to offer. Until videogame designers and players outgrow this quantity-over-quality mindset—both in the AAA and indie scenes—videogames will struggle to be an outlet of creative expression.

##Discontinuity

One of the great strengths of videogames is to offer an immersive, continuous interactive experience in real time. Early pioneers of the in-engine cutscene, like the *Half-Life* franchise, took great pride in offering the player experiences *entirely* in real time, without any breaks for level changes, loading screens, pre-rendered cutscenes, or other such folderol. This a videogame!, they proclaim, the interactivty must never be interrupted!

Indeed, there are good reasons not to interfere with the player's interaction of your game. Such interference with the feedback loop can prove fatal to the player's sense of immersion, without which your game is only so much bright colors and loud noises. But the player is not feeding back into the loop 100% of the time. Already there are times in in-engine cutscenes when the player is expected to relinquish some control and let the game do its thing. 

In a novel, you would not expect the narrator to tell you every time a character opens a door, presses a button, or reloads their weapon. In a film, we do not follow the protagonist from their front door all the way to their office. Creators in these media use techniques to cut out things that are not necessary to the story or the mood; except for the biggest, most obvious kinds of discontuity, such as between major levels, videogames at present are almost entirely without such techniques.

There are games for which uninterrupted continuity really works, like the aforementioned *Half-Life* games. It would be folly, however, to insist that all or even most stories we might want to tell with videogames benefit from this approach. At the very least, it seems hard to argue that game designers would be harmed by having more choices in the ways to tell their stories. Two games that do discontinuity well are *dys4ia* and *30 Flights of Loving*.

##Meaningful Modes of Interaction

It is really kind of appaling that in 30 years of experimentation, we still haven't come up with any good ways to interact with a real-time 3D world in anything but a physical way.
