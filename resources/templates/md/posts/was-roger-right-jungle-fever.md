*Jungle Fever* is Spike Lee's fifth film, about an affair between a married black architect named Flipper (Wesley Snipes) and his young white secretary Angie (Annabella Sciorra). Like many of Lee's films, a story ostensibly about sexual attraction takes characters (and the viewer) deep into a world intensely preoccupied with race. And, like many of Spike Lee's films, it is filled with complex, warm, and troubled characters who have difficulty understanding each other. But what did Roger Ebert think?

##Was Roger Right about **Jungle Fever**?


Roger Ebert put his finger right on the nebulous thought growing in my mind immediately after I saw this film:


>Because I have heard Lee discuss the film, I know he believes that the Snipes and Sciorro [*sic*] characters are blinded to other issues by each other's blackness and whiteness—that she is intrigued by the myth of black male prowess, that he is fascinated by the ideal of white female beauty. But in fact neither of these notions is really established in the film, which is the least successful and focused in the scenes between its two principals. We never really believe the attraction they feel for one another, we never really understand their relationship, and their romance seems to be mostly an excuse for the other events in the movie to happen—the events that make the film special.


Their transition from believable, if tame, flirtation to outright adultery is quite abrupt, probably for plot reasons, and one wonders why Wesley Snipes would even consider risking his personal life on such a meaningless fling. That said, we also don't have any reason to believe their attraction was based in racial stereotypes, taboo, or fetishization. They certainly had no other reason to be together; perhaps Lee meant us to infer the eponymous fever by process of elimination. I left under the impression that, while both characters were *told* they had it by their combative and distrustful social circle, they both ignored the suggestion as reductive and insulting, to themselves and their partner. 

What's very interesting is that as much as I agree with what he wrote above, so do I equally strongly disagree with the very next sentence:

>It's as if Lee himself, as a screenwriter, could see these characters only as stereotypes—could not, or would not, get inside of them. 

I have never once seen a Spike Lee character I thought of a stereotype. I believe Lee is incapable of thinking in stereotypes. In fact, I believe Lee's failure was of seeing *too much* humanity in his characters—he seems to care for them all so much he can't bear to give them such damning and ugly flaws. Not that his characters are perfect, mind; his characters are always human and thus flawed. But they are flawed in subtle ways, to engage the viewer's sympathy. Such objectification and dehumanization seems almost beyond sympathy; I suspect Lee didn't have the heart to subject his protagonists to that kind of scorn.

Another area where Roger and I disagree is the extensive side plot about Gator, the protagonist's older brother, a deceitful and disloyal crackhead. I said that Lee can't think in stereotypes. Gator, as a poor, good-for-nothing drug addict taking advantage of his long-suffering mother and avoiding his stern, moralizing father, might have been a damaging black stereotype had Samuel L Jackson not brought to this role, as he brings to all his roles, his fierce, devious intelligence. Gator is a deadbeat, but no loser: he's self-aware and apathetic. When he tells his brother that he's a crackhead and will never change, he's not spouting an excuse: he's explaining something that is obvious to him. When he looks sincerely at his mother and lies his ass off to her face, and does a cutesy little dance, you sense it isn't the drugs that drove him to this. Gator would be a self-serving sociopath no matter what.

So it sounds like I like this sub-plot, and so does Roger:

> Meanwhile, there is another story in "Jungle Fever," the story of Gator, the brother who is a crackhead. Lee shows how drugs can split a family down the middle, so that while one brother is a white-collar success, another is trapped in a hell of addiction. The most harrowing sequence in the movie follows Flipper as he searches for Gator through the demonic sewers where crackheads gather—until finally there is a scene out of Dante, in a crackhouse where the moments of release are surrounded by a great bottomless pall of despair.

First of all, I didn't find this sequence all *that* harrowing, but mostly I'd like to mention that while I do think Gator's story is well-told, it has *absolutely no business being in this movie*. The end of the Gator story serves as *the climax of the film*, after the Angie/Flipper romance has been wrapped-up unceremoniously and before the denoument that ties up everything else. Spike Lee has a knack for making films with several intertwining stories and characters, but the absolutely disproportiate weight he places on the Gator story sticks out like a sore thumb. It feels like Lee was just about to wrap this project when a friend of his had a drug overdose, and he decided to add 40 minutes of a "Just Say No" PSA to the storyline. It was extremely well-done<label for="sn-welldone" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-welldone" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote">The very last shot of the film has Flipper embrace a drug-addicted prostitute who has propositioned him on the street and cry out in despair. So, y'know, not always well-done.</span> but never well-integrated. Fleshed out, it might have stood on its own as a great film; as it is, it hangs an awkward millstone around the neck of a very different film. It does a disservice to that film by distracting from it, and it is done a disservice itself by being prevented from taking center-stage. 

##In Conclusion

**My Score**: 4/5

**Roger's Score**: 3.5/4

**Was Roger Right?**: Roger is right that, while a compelling and expertly-told story, it fails in its purported premise to indict a culture of fetishization. He is also right that Gator's story is equally compelling, but perhaps he is too disappointed in the main plot to see how much better either story would do on its own.
